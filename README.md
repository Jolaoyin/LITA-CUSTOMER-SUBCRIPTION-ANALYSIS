  ### Data Cleaning and Preparations
 During the initial phase, we engage in an exploration and summarization of the customer subscription data to gain essential insights into customer behavior, subscription trends, and overall engagement patterns.
  1. Removed duplicates and checked for missing data value
  2. Created a new column "Subscription_Duration", which calculates the duration between "Subscription Started" and "Subscription Ended"
  3. Validate the accuracy of the data to ensure its reliability for analysis
  
## Exploratory Data Analysis
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase is crucial for understanding the customer subscription data and uncovering patterns that can inform strategic decisions.
